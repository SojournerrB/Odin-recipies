    <p>------------------</p>
    <p>Porkchops are a versatile and flavorful culinary piece. On this page, we'll talk about how to make my absolute favorite way to cook them.</p>
    <p><em>This recipe will only cover porkchops as a main dish. If you'd like to see options for sides, navigate to the "sides" page and find one that looks tasty!</em></p>

    <h1>Porkchop Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Porkchops, obviously</li>
            <li>Half a stick of butter</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Chili Powder</li>
            <li>Bunches of Thyme, as a garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>Let's get started!</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Firstly, its a smart idea to use some shears to cut slits in the fat of the porkchops. This will prevent them from curling as they cook.</li>
        <li>Mix some salt, pepper, and chili powder together until a complete mixure. Measure with your heart!</li>
        <li>Season both sides of your porkchops with the seasoning mixure.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan opn a medium heat. Once the pan is warm, add a swirl of oil and your butter.</li>
        <li>Allow the butter and oil to coat the bottom of the pan, then add your porkchops. Be sure to move them around on the pan to prevent them sticking!</li>
        <li>Add in a few bunches of thyme to the pan.</li>
        <li>While the chops are cooking, baste them with a spoon to help bring the center to temperature</li>
        <li>Once the middle of the chops reaches 160 degrees, they're complete. Take them off the heat and let them rest</li>
    </ol>
    <P>That's it! This method of cooking porkchops is my favorite, as the basting makes them super moist and tender. It's also stupidly easy!</P>
